# Parallel partial emulation in `gpytorch`

Notebooks accompanying the implementation of parallel partial emulation in `gpytorch`.

Currently, this repository contains the following notebooks:
- [Parallel_Partial_GP_Regression](Parallel_Partial_GP_Regression.ipynb): an example notebook demonstrating the use of parallel partial emulation with `gpytorch`
- [GPytorch_Scaling_Test_PP_vs_MT](GPytorch_Scaling_Test_PP_vs_MT.ipynb): a notebook comparing the time complexity of parallel partial emulation and multitask Gaussian Process regression
- [GPytorch_Scaling_Test_PP_vs_BI](GPytorch_Scaling_Test_PP_vs_BI.ipynb): a notebook comparing the time complexity of parallel partial emulation and batch-independent Gaussian Process regression
